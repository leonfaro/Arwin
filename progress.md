# Progress Log

- Created `AGENTS.md` with contributor instructions as per project requirements.
- Initialized `progress.md` to track future changes.
- Added rule that code should be uncommented, use base R (except ggplot2), avoid extra packages, and stay simple.
- Extracted POI, sPOI mono, and sPOI combo worksheets to CSV via `extract_csvs.R`; checked row counts (104/29/56) and trimmed whitespace.
